# SC627-Motion Planning & Coordination of Autonomous Vehicles
This is the official GitHub repository for the SC627 Course Spring semester-2024, and all the content and assignments related to tutorials will be added here. Frequently check the README.md for updates.
## Pre-requisites
In the Tutorial sections, we will cover the working of ROS1, and ROS2, simulations with Gazebo, and related hardware experiments. We will be using both Python and C++ as programming languages. If you are not familiar with programming, it will be difficult to get through the tutorials, doing a basic course on Python and C++ might help. Check out this fast track courses for [Python](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses_v2/fast-track-python) and [C++](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses_v2/fast-track-cpp)
### Install Ubuntu 20.04
Throughout the course, we will be working on Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS. If you are not running Ubuntu already, I would recommend installing it before the class. 

1. Back up your system, if the installation goes wrong, you can recover.
2. Follow the [official Ubuntu tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview) for installation.
3. If you prefer a [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/BnV23ZEI34w)
4. All students are required to have Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS installed on their Laptops/Computers for the course.
5. If you are new to Linux systems, understand how Linux works and its basic commands. Here is a [beautiful document](https://nu-msr.github.io/hackathon/linux_interactive.html) to get you through.
6. You can also use Windows /virtual machine for the ROS and Gazebo, but since they are not supported primarily and tend to cause a lot of issues, we recommend you stick to Ubuntu. In the case of Windows and virtual machines, we won't be able to assist the problems you face.

### Install ROS1 and ROS2
1. [Install ROS1 Noetic](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)
    -  Be sure to follow all of the instructions!
    -  Install the full-desktop version
    -  Add the environment setup to your .bashrc
    -  Install the dependencies for building packages
2. [Install ROS2 Foxy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)
    -  Same instructions apply
