# SC627-Motion Planning & Coordination of Autonomous Vehicles

## Pre-requisites

### Install Ubuntu 20.04
Throughout the course, we will be working on Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS. If you are not running Ubuntu already, I would recommend installing it before the class. 

1. Back up your system, if the installation goes wrong you can recover.
2. Follow the [official Ubuntu tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview) for installation.
3. If you prefer a [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/BnV23ZEI34w)
4. All students are required to have Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS installed on their Laptops/Computers for the course.
5. If you are new to Linux systems, understand how Linux works and its basic commands. Here is a [beautiful document](https://nu-msr.github.io/hackathon/linux_interactive.html) to get you through.
6. You can also use Windows /virtual machine for the ROS and Gazebo but since they are not supported primarily and tend to cause a lot of issues we recommend you stick to Ubuntu. In the case of Windows and virtual machines, we won't be able to assist the problems you face.
